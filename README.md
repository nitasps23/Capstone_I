#### Capstone I Project: Medical Insurance Cost Analysis
#### Objective:
> This project aims to analyze the key factors influencing medical costs in the U.S., given the substantial financial burden healthcare imposes on individuals and families. Using a dataset from Kaggle with 2,772 observations and 7 variables (Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, Charges), the goal is to identify the top drivers of medical expenses.

#### Steps:
> 1. Data Exploration and Structure:
      - Confirmed that the dataset is clean with no missing values.
      - Analyzed the data structure, identifying the variables to be used in the analysis.
> 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
      - Charges: Assessed distribution, summary statistics, and identified charges as the dependent variable.
      - Age: Discretized age into groups, analyzed distribution, and examined the correlation between age and charges.
      - Gender: Explored the difference in charges between males and females and further analyzed the impact of gender across age groups.
      - BMI: Categorized BMI into groups, analyzed its distribution, and investigated its effect on medical costs, particularly across different age and gender groups.
      - Children: Examined the impact of the number of children on medical costs, with a deeper look into how this varies by age and gender.
> 3. Summary and Analysis:
      - Identified that age, BMI, and smoking status are the most significant factors affecting medical costs.
      - Observed that higher charges are generally associated with older age groups, higher BMI, and smoking.
      - Gender and the number of children had a less pronounced impact on costs but were still considered in the overall analysis.
> 4. Conclusion: The analysis provided insights into which factors most strongly influence medical insurance costs, guiding future pricing and risk assessment strategies for insurance companies.
